## Building Transparent and Trustable A.I. Dashboard for Cybersecurity Operators

# Introduction

I led the product design and UI / UX design for an A.I.-assisted cybersecurity dashboard that helps security operators monitor and analyst online traffics.

# Process

When I joined the team, there was a big divide between Graphen’s technical solutions and user’s day-to-day life. I led the end-to-end product design process from technical solutions to the end execution.

**Roles**
I worked with a interdisciplinary team of data scientists, developers, project manager and clients.

**PROBLEM**
How A.I. can help with cybersecurity problems? Finding an answer was my starting point. It gave us some goal to strive for.
Cybersecurity operators suffer from long work hours and high stress from high stakes while the industry is suffering from unmet demands.
Hackers are constantly improve their attack methods and don’t follow a 9-to-6 schedule. A.I. can help with those problems by being constantly vigilant, and being able to adapt to new attacks.

**USER CONTEXT AND PAIN POINTS**
I worked with stakeholders, project managers, cybersecurity practitioners (users) and external experts to define key personas and to summarize their pain points.
Basically there are two roles: a junior operators and a senior analyst. Junior operator will do a initial screening and report to suspicious anomaly to analyst who will trace the origin of the anomaly, verify if it is indeed a threat, and create a plan to stop or defend against a possible attack.

**CONVERT PAIN POINTS TO FEATURES**
Our team brainstormed several ways to resolve user’s pain points. We marked them with complexity (how much resource each feature needs in terms of time / development resource) and importance to user and to enterprise stakeholders.

**CHALLENGE**
Remember that security officer is a job with high stakes? That means low margin of error and they can’t a trust a machine unless it is 100% accurate. This creates a challenge that even state of the art technology won’t satisfy with user’s demands, and we have to anticipate user’s needs to investigate A.I.’s decision-making process to see if it is right or wrong.

![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_9FCB84EFBC580CB5605114E61EA103B6902650A4F0886287613E54B90E99A86C_1566179622877_image.png)

A.I.’s thinking process can be a black box that is hard to read. It sees and learns numbers and their reasoning can be a string of numbers, like 0.76 which roughly translates to 76% confident that they made a right prediction. It was a very challenging to solve that require the efforts of the whole industry. Meanwhile, we decided to give our user the ability to investigate the same information that our robot’s decision-making was based on if we give them the right tool to probe and visualize data. Thinking about our A.I. is an alert dog that’s guarding the house. It can smell something far ahead of human, but they need human to eventually find out what went wrong.

**INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE**

With core features laid out, I created the information architecture with project managers. We further examined the feasibility of each feature with details and decided to focus on a dashboard and visualize tools first.
Then I created a low-to-medium fidelity mock-up to discuss details with users, stakeholders and experts. After reaching a consensus, I started to work on visual design and technical demos of visualizations.

These screenshots show the final design we implemented. The first screen is an dashboard that we addressed user’s needs to do high-level system screening and being able to investigate various data points with the ability to see more detailed explanations, instead of having to manually researching each data like what their used to do.

These screens showed two visualizations we implemented to investigate relationships between each device. A relational graph visualizer is commonly used in this type of applications, but ours is one of the first to use a 3D visualization. By giving our user more controls to do advanced investigations, our users can verify A.I.’s decision-making process instead of having to trust a black-box oracle’s predictions.

In order to design the UI I showed above, I created a set of visual elements to guide and facilitate future design work. We have a small develop team so it doesn’t make sense to create our own design system at the early stage. Those visual building blocks sufficed our needs at the moment, but also give directions if we want to add new UI components or new visualizations.

NEXT STEP

We only worked on a tool to poke the surface of the ocean of data. There are still much opportunity to smarten-up the A.I. to give more responsive and valid predictions, with better explainations. Once the system is robust enough, the team can focus on bring a better experience for team members to communicate with each other.
